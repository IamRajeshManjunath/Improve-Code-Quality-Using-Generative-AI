# Improve-Code-Quality-Using-Generative-AI

#Description:
Simulated business scenario:
To boost developer productivity, the city's IT team wants to implement a new code analysis tool. When developers start work on client projects, they must quickly grasp the project's codebase and learn to refine existing source code or integrate new code. The new tool should help developers analyze code to spot defects and deviations from coding best practices. It should also assist them in finding creative ways to fix defective code.

#Overview:
In this AWS SimuLearn assignment, you review a real-world scenario, helping a fictional customer design a solution on AWS.
After the design is completed, you build the proposed solution in a guided lab within a live AWS Management Console environment.
You gain hands-on experience working with AWS services, using the same tools technology professionals use to construct AWS solutions.

Objectives:
Demonstrate how to incorporate machine learning to identify code defects and best practice deviations.
Learn how to use automated reasoning to provide actionable code improvement insights.
Demonstrate how to implement ML-powered tools to monitor and optimize application performance.
Demonstrate how to build a self-serve generative AI tool to help developers evaluate and fix code issues.
